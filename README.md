# django_js

## Love the simple things
1. Just make sure you have docker installed in your machine check [a link] (https://www.docker.com/)
2. Just change the docker compose file volume directory to where you saved the project and just run "docker compose up"
3. View the project on [a link] (127.0.0.1:8081)

Yeah!!! That's all. Check out the project
