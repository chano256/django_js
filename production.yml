1. Removing any volume bindings for application code,
so that code stays inside the container and canâ€™t be changed from outside
2. Binding to different ports on the host
3. Setting environment variables differently,
such as reducing the verbosity of logging,
or to specify settings for external services such as an email server
4. Specifying a restart policy like 'restart always' to avoid downtime
5. Adding extra services such as a log aggregator
